## Development Notes

### Class Responsibilities

**Model Classes (Game Logic):**
- `BetCard` - Manages player's number selections
- `Player` - Tracks total winnings and history
- `GamePlay` - Controls game flow and drawing logic
- `DisplayOdds` - Stores NC lottery payout table
- `Winnings` - Calculates payouts based on matches
- `DrawnNumbers` - Generates 20 random unique numbers
- `RoundResult` - Data storage for each drawing result

**View Classes (UI):**
- `KenoMain` - Application entry point
- `SceneSwitch` - Manages scene transitions
- `HomeMain` - Welcome screen with menu
- `GameMain` - Main game interface with GridPane

### Design Decisions

- Used HashSet for number storage to prevent duplicates
- Separated game logic from UI for easier testing
- Implemented defensive copying in getters to protect data
- Used animations for better user experience
- GridPane chosen for bet card as required by project spec

## Testing

Run all tests:
```bash
mvn test
```

Expected: At least 25 tests covering:
- BetCard selection logic
- DrawnNumbers generation
- DisplayOdds payout calculations
- Player winnings tracking
- GamePlay drawing mechanics
- Input validation
